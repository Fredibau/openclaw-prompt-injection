# Security Policy

## Defensive Research Only

This repository is for **defensive security research** and educational purposes. The goal is to help developers and researchers understand and mitigate prompt injection vulnerabilities in agentic systems.

## Responsible Use

- **Isolated Testing**: Only test these payloads in sandboxed, isolated environments.
- **No Live Targets**: Do not use payloads from this repository against production systems, live websites, or any third-party services.
- **No Malware**: Do not submit payloads that contain actual malware, viruses, or code designed to damage host systems. This benchmark is strictly for *prompt injection* (instruction hijacking).

## Reporting Issues

If you find a security issue *with this repository itself* (e.g., a malicious submission that slipped through), please open a GitHub Issue or contact the maintainers directly.
